                <p>Hello, my name is Steven Baty. I'm an accomplished customer service representative who has recently 
                completed the University of Utah's concentrated path for full stack web developer. I have passion for 
                solving problems and searching for innovative solutions and applying this skill set through tech development. 
                I bring a range of experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, PWA, React, MongoDB, Express, and Node.</p>
                <p>I'm looking for a position where I can use my excellent communication and people skills, while applying my 
                new coding knowledge. I love fast-paced environments and want to contribute to a company's growth and customer 
                happiness. Finding a role with a technology company where I can grow my skills and use my background of delivering 
                impeccable service interactions is my goal.</p>
                <p>I'm a very dedicated worker; willing to dive in and learn new skills and turn those into actions that benefit 
                the business. Let's chat if this sounds like the person you're looking for.</p>
